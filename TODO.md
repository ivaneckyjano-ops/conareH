# Todo List - conareH Project

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze VS Code logs
  - Identified MESA-LOADER errors (missing DRI drivers: iris_dri.so, kms_swrast_dri.so, swrast_dri.so)
  - Found issue: ~/.config/Code/Backups causing multiple window restore
  - Solution: Move Backups folder, use --disable-gpu flag

- [x] Close duplicate VS Code sessions & restart clean
  - Stopped all running VS Code/snap processes
  - Backed up and moved ~/.config/Code/Backups
  - Started VS Code with --disable-extensions --disable-gpu
  - Verified single window, no duplicate parasitic windows

- [x] Fix MESA/GPU drivers
  - Installed mesa-utils and mesa-utils-bin
  - libgl1-mesa-dri was already present
  - Decision: Continue using --disable-gpu in headless/VM environment

- [x] Sanitize /root/tmp/conareH-clean
  - Scanned for secrets (.env files, tokens, secrets)
  - Removed .codespaces folder (contained: .env, .env-secrets, user-secrets.json)
  - Removed .git history to prevent secret exposure
  - Created fresh git repo from sanitized tree
  - Initial commit: "Initial sanitized snapshot: removed secrets and .codespaces"

- [x] Resolve SSH auth and push to conareH
  - SSH key authentication was blocked (Permission denied publickey)
  - Generated new SSH RSA 4096-bit key in Codespaces (~/.ssh/codespaces_key)
  - Added public key to GitHub account settings
  - Successfully pushed to origin/main using SSH

- [x] Collect extra logs if needed
  - Verified VS Code startup and process management
  - Confirmed git operations and push status

## Project Summary

**Repository**: https://github.com/ivaneckyjano-ops/conareH
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Sanitized snapshot successfully pushed to GitHub

### Key Locations
- **Sanitized working repo**: `/workspaces/conareH-clean` (Codespaces)
- **Original repo**: `/workspaces/test` (contains secrets in history)
- **Secrets backup**: `~/secure-backups/` (safe location)
- **SSH key**: `~/.ssh/codespaces_key` (GitHub authorized)

### What Was Removed
- `.codespaces/` folder and all contents
- `.env` and `.env-secrets` files
- User secrets JSON files
- `.git` history (fresh start)

### Recommendations
1. Use VS Code with `--disable-gpu` on headless/VM environments
2. Store sensitive files in `~/secure-backups` not in version control
3. Use `.gitignore` for future `.env` and sensitive file protection
4. Keep SSH keys safe (current key: ~/.ssh/codespaces_key)

## Notes for Future Agent Sessions
- This TODO.md should be updated after each significant change
- Keep track of all sanitization/security operations
- Document any new VS Code issues in this file
